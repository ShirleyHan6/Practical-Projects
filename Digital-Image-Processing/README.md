This repository contains codes on the usage of libjpeg-turbo API. I used VS2017 as the tool for running this project. 

The two source files are for 
-converting JPEG image to BMP image and getting the RGB24 Array from the BMP image

Getting the RGB Array is the first step we need to achieve to use OpenCV algorithms for computer vision work.
